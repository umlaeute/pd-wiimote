pd-wiimote for Debian
---------------------

The [wiimote] PureData external provides an interface to Nintendo's
famous wireless Wiimote controller.

It has support for:
 * All buttons
 * 3-axis accelerometers
 * LED 1-4
 * Rumble motor
 * IR-Blob tracking Camera (up to 4 blobs)

The following extensions are also supported:
 * Nunchuk (analog stick, 3-axis accelerometer)
 * Motion Plus (3-axis gyroscope)
 * Classic Controller (buttons and analog sticks)

These extensions are still untested, but might work:
 * Balance Board

This is a fork of the wiimote external written by Mike Wozniewski.
It is currently developed by IOhannes m zm√∂lnig.
