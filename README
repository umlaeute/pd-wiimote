wiimote for Pd
==============

[wiimote] is a Pd-object that allows to read data from a Wii Remote Controller
it depends on libcwiid, which is currently only available on linux


random notes
============

extensions
----------
the external is known to support the nunchuck, classic, motionplus extensions
the balance extension might work, but is currently untested (if it doesn't work
and you need it, contact me to and send me the hardware)

motionplus
----------
the motionplus extension for the wiimote is supported (out of the box, see
above).
however, older releases of libcwiid are inaccurate at detecting rotation speed
(the wii remote reports whether the controller is turned fast or slow; this info
is missing in libcwiid).
if you have such a version of libcwiid and need higher precision, you have to
patch the sources of libcwiid:
$ cd /path/to/cwiid/libcwiid
$ patch < /path/to/wiimote/patches/cwiid201_motionplus_sensitivity.patch
$ cd /path/to/cwiid/
$ make (read README to see how to patch libcwiid)

once you have done that, you need to make the external aware of the new feature.
for this create a file 
/path/to/wiimote/Make.local
and add the following line:
CFLAGS += -DHAVE_CWIID_MOTIONPLUS_LOWSPEED

then recompile wiimote
